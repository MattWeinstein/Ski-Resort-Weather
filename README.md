# Ski-Resort-Weather

Many times I have scoured the internet the day before a skiing day trip to find which mountain has the best weather. With the Ikon pass, I have the freedom of going to a select number of mountains and i'd like to find the one with the most optimal weather.

The goal of this application is to have the user get the weather for any day at any mountain. The user will be able to select the pass they have (Ikon/Epic) and which region they are looking for (Northeast/Colorado/Utah)

Using a weather API, the forecast for that day will appear in the DOM.

No longer will you have to open 5 web pages every hour the day before hitting the slopes!
